Fake B2B SaaS start up using HubSpot

This project generates realistic, HubSpot-style CRM datasets for testing, analysis, or demonstrations.
It uses Python, pandas, and faker to output synthetic CSVs with properties and relationships modeled after HubSpot CRM objects.

The script produces the following files:

contacts.csv â€“ fake people with HubSpot-style fields (e.g., firstname, lastname, email, jobtitle, lifecyclestage).

companies.csv â€“ fake organizations with properties like name, industry, annualrevenue, numberofemployees.

deals.csv â€“ sales deals tied to contacts and companies (fields like dealname, pipeline, dealstage, amount).

tickets.csv â€“ support tickets related to customers, with realistic subjects (e.g., UI issues, integration errors, user permissions).

engagements.csv â€“ activities such as calls, emails, and meetings linked to contacts and deals.
